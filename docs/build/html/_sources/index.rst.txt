Welcome to Spy4Cast's documentation! |ICON|
===========================================

**Spy4Cast** is a framework for working with .nc files and applying methodologies to them as well as plotting.

.. note::
   If you see anywhere in the docs or in the files `slise` and think it is a typo, it is not. Python has a built-in function called `slice` and in this library we have decided to use `slise` to avoid unexpected behaviours. I hope it is not too ugly...

.. note::
   This project is under active developement
